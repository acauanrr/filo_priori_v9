# Fine-Tuning Configuration for BGE Embeddings - CPU VERSION
# Optimized for CPU training (fallback when GPU has issues)
#
# This configuration fine-tunes BGE-Large for software engineering domain
# using contrastive learning with triplets generated from test execution history.
#
# Hardware Requirements:
# - CPU: Multi-core recommended
# - RAM: 64GB+ recommended
# - Disk: ~10GB for checkpoints
#
# Expected Training Time (CPU):
# - Small (10K triplets): ~2-3 hours
# - Medium (100K triplets): ~20-30 hours
# - Full (1M+ triplets): ~100-150 hours (NOT RECOMMENDED on CPU)

# Data Configuration
data:
  train_path: "datasets/train.csv"

  # Sample size for quick testing (set to null for full dataset)
  # CPU is SLOW - recommend starting with small sample
  sample_size: 10000  # For quick testing (2-3 hours on CPU)
  # sample_size: null  # Full dataset (100+ hours on CPU - NOT RECOMMENDED)

# Triplet Generation Configuration
triplet:
  # Minimum number of failed builds required per test case
  min_fail_builds: 1

  # Minimum number of passed builds required per test case
  min_pass_builds: 1

  # Maximum triplets to generate per test case
  # Higher = more training data but slower generation
  max_triplets_per_test: 10

  # Cache path for generated triplets (speeds up re-runs)

# Model Configuration
model:
  # Base model to fine-tune

  # Embedding dimension (1024 for BGE-Large)
  embedding_dim: 1024

# Training Configuration
training:
  # Number of training epochs

  num_epochs: 5

  # Batch size
  # CPU has memory constraints and is slower
  # Recommended: 8-16 for BGE-Large on CPU
  # Smaller batch = slower but uses less memory
  batch_size: 8  # Optimized for CPU training

  # Learning rate
  # Recommended: 2e-5 to 5e-5 for fine-tuning
  learning_rate: 3e-5

  # Triplet margin
  # Distance threshold between anchor-positive and anchor-negative
  # Higher = stricter separation requirement
  triplet_margin: 0.5

  # Checkpoint saving
  checkpoint_save_steps: 500  # Save every 500 steps
  checkpoint_save_total_limit: 3  # Keep only 3 most recent checkpoints

  # Mixed precision training (FP16)
  # Speeds up training and reduces memory usage
  use_amp: true

# Evaluation Configuration
evaluation:
  # Validate on sample triplets every N steps
  eval_steps: 500

  # Number of triplets to use for validation
  eval_sample_size: 1000

# Hardware Configuration
hardware:
  device: "cpu"  # Force CPU usage (change to "cuda" if GPU works)
  num_workers: 4  # Data loading workers
  pin_memory: false  # Not needed for CPU

# Advanced Training Options
advanced:
  # Gradient accumulation steps
  # Effective batch size = batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps
  # Use if you want larger effective batch size
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 1

  # Weight decay for regularization
  weight_decay: 0.01

  # Max gradient norm for clipping
  max_grad_norm: 1.0

  # Warmup ratio (fraction of training for learning rate warmup)
  warmup_ratio: 0.1

# Logging Configuration
logging:
  # Log training metrics every N steps
  log_steps: 100

  # Save training logs to file
  log_to_file: true

# Output Configuration
output:
  # Save final model
  save_final_model: true

  # Save intermediate checkpoints
  save_checkpoints: true

  # Export model to ONNX format (for deployment)
  export_onnx: false

# Notes:
# 1. First run with sample_size=10000 to test (~30 min)
# 2. Then run with sample_size=null for full dataset (~10-15 hours)
# 3. Monitor GPU usage with: watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
# 4. Check training progress in: logs/finetune_bge.log
# 5. Fine-tuned model will be in: models/finetuned_bge_v1/
